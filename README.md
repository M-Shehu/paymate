## 🤔 What is PayMate?  
PayMate is a web app designed to handle payment to suppliers for small businesses. The web app is built with PayStack as the payment gateway and was built as a simple tool to demonstrate the flexibility and simplicity of the PayStack&trade; API. *It's also made to lowkey impress the guys down at PayStack&trade;. I hope I'm doing a good job at that.*
